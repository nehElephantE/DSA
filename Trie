TRIE

TRIE

-> also known as retrieval tree, digital search and prefix tree
-> this data structure helps to store common info only once.....apple aur app mein app aur le alag alag store karna hai
-> search complexity = O(L) where L is the length of word...hence for searching Trie is the best data structure
-> root is always the empty node
words[]="the","a","there","their","any"

()->(t)->(h)->(e)end->(r)->(e)end
()->(a)end->(n)->(y)

(e)end->(i)->(r)

class Node{
  Node[] children;............root node khali abh wahan se level1 pe words ke 1st letter store honge joh ki a-z ho sakte hai hence array of 26 
  boolean endOfWord;
}

-> har ek node pe ek array hai 26 size ka jahan pe index 0 pe a aur 1 be b ,3 pe c and so on
 -> inserion time complexity O(L)
